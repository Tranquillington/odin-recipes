        <h1>Pepperoni and Ham Pizza</h1>
        <img src="../images/Pep_ham_pizza.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pepperoni pizza is an American pizza variety which 
            includes one of the country's most beloved toppings. 
            Pepperoni is actually a corrupted form of peperoni 
            (one “p”), 
            which denotes a large pepper in Italian, 
            but nowadays it denotes a spicy salami, 
            usually made with a mixture of beef, pork, and spices.
            This, <em>combined</em> with the <strong>delicious</strong>
             taste of Ham creates a symphony of flavor that is 
             not healthy, but absolutley delicious!</p>
